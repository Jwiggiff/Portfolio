        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
        <p>Often it is useful to be able to search for a specific value in an array. In this lesson you will learn two of the most common ways of searching through an array. Keep in mind that there are many other ways of searching through an array, some of which may be more efficient or more applicable for your specific situation.</p>
        <h1 id="big-o">Big O Notation</h1>
        <p>Big O notation is a special notation used in computer programming to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It can be used to either describe the execution time required for an algorithm, or the space in memory used. N is used to describe the length of the array in this case. For Example, an algorithm with O(N) time complexity would take 5 comparisons on an array of 5 elements, and 18 comparisons on an array of 18 elements. This notation will be used later on to describe the time complexity of the two algorithms that will be discussed.</p>
        <h1 id="sequential">Sequential Search</h1>
        <p>Sequential search is one of the most basic ways of searching through an array. It is often one of the first to be taught as it is extremely simple to understand and implement. First, I will explain how it works, and then how to implement it in Java.</p>
        <p>Sequential search is a very simple searching algorithm used to search through arrays. It is very similar to how a human might search through a pile of papers to find a specific one. It simply goes through each element of the array from the beginning to the end and checks if the current element is equal to the element that it is looking for. Here is an example of how it would be implemented in Java.</p>
        <pre><code>int[] arr = {2,5,3,4,65,43,21,1}; //The array being searched
int key = 4; //The element to search for
boolean found = false; //Whether the element has been found or not
for (int i : arr) {
  if (i == key) //Checks if the current element is equal to the element being searched for
    found = true; //Sets found to true if the element is found
    break; //Break out of the loop once it is found
}
System.out.println(found); //Will output true of found, false otherwise</code></pre>
        <p>As you can see, this algorithm is not very efficient, especially on larger arrays. The efficiency of this algorithm can be written as O(N). This means that the worst case will take the same number of comparisons as the length of the array. This is ok for smaller arrays, however we can be much more efficient when using larger data sets.</p>
        <h1 id="binary">Binary Search</h1>
        <p>Binary search is a much more efficient algorithm for searching an array. It is often used in larger projects or on larger data sets as it is much more efficient. However, a major drawback of binary search is that it only works on sorted data sets. Binary search works by finding the middle element of the array and checking whether it is smaller, larger, or equal to the key. If it is equal, then we have found the key. Otherwise, it will shrink the searched portion to either the first half or second half depending on whether it is smaller or larger than the key. It will then perform a binary search on the smaller section, and keep repeating this process until either the key is found or the upper and lower bounds of the searched area are equal. Here is an example of how it would be implemented in Java.</p>
        <pre><code>int[] arr = {2,5,3,4,65,43,21,1}; //The array being searched
int key = 4; //The element to search for
boolean found = false; //Whether the element has been found or not
int upper = arr.length; //The upper bounds of the searched portion
int lower = 0; //The lower bounds of the searched portion
while (lower <= upper) {
  int mid = (low+high)/2;
  if (arr[mid] > key) {
    upper = mid-1;
  }
  else if (arr[mid] < key) {
    lower = mid+1;
  }
  else { //The element is found
    found = true;
    break;
  }
}
System.out.println(found); //Will output true of found, false otherwise</code></pre>
        <p>As you can see, this algorithm is much more efficient than sequential search. The time complexity in Big O notation of this algorithm is O(log N).</p>
